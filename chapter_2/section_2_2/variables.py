# ----- Examples of declaring variables -----
# x = 10      # x is an integer (int)
# y = 3.14   # y is a floating-point number (float)
# name = "Alice"  # name is a string (str)
# In Python, you can use either single quotes or double quotes for strings
# ----- Examples of declaring variables -----

# Example 1 - Create 3 variables
# create a string variable called message and assign it the value And now for something completely different
message = 'And now for something completely different'
# create an integer variable called n and assign it the value 17
n = 17
# create a float variable called pi and assign it the value 3.1415926535897931
pi = 3.1415926535897931

# display the value stored in the variable called message in the console
print(message)
# display the value stored in the variable called n in the console
print(n)
# display the value stored in the variable called pi in the console
print(pi)

# check the data type of the value stored in variable message display the type in the console
print( type(message) )
# check the data type of the value stored in variable n display the type in the console
print( type(n) )
# check the data type of the value stored in variable pi display the type in the console
print( type(pi) )
