# String Operations

# Example 1 - Add two integer values
# create an integer variable called first and assign it the value 10
first = 10
# create an integer variable called second and assign it the value 15
second = 15
# add the value stored in variables first and second and display the value in the console
print(first+second)

# Example 2 - Concatenate two string values
# create a string variable called first and assign it the value 100
first = '100'
# create a string variable called second and assign it the value 150
second = '150'
# since the values stored in variables first and second are string
# when using the + sign that Concatenates them. It joins the two strings together.
# So the string 100 is joined with string 150 , so 100150 is displayed in the console
print(first+second)
