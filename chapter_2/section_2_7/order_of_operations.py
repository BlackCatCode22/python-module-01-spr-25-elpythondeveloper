# Order Of Operations
# Acronym PEMDAS can be used to remember the Order of is precedence.
# Order of is precedence - Parentheses, Exponentiation, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction

# example 1 - use order of operation and display the result in the console - result should be 4
# ----------------
# The operations inside parentheses are calculated first
# 1 is subtracted from 3 which is 2, then 2 is multiplied by 2 which is 4.
# ----------------
# perform order operations calc and display the result in the console
print ( 2 * (3-1) )

# example 2 - use order of operation and display the result in the console - result should be 8
# ----------------
# The operations inside parentheses are calculated first
# 1 is added with 1 first which is 2, then 5 is subtracted by 2 which is 3.
# Then 2 to the 3rd power is 8.
# ----------------
# perform order operations calc and display the result in the console
print ( (1+1)**(5-2) )

# example 3 - use order of operation and display the result in the console - result should be 3.33
# ----------------
# The operations inside parentheses are calculated first
# 2 is multiplied with 100 which is 200, then 200 is divided by 60.
# ----------------
# create an integer variable called minute and assign it the value 2
minute = 2
# perform order operations calc and display the result in the console
print ( (minute * 100) /60 )
