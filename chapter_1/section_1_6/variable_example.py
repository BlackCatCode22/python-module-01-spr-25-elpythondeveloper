# ----- Examples of declaring variables -----
# x = 10      # x is an integer (int)
# y = 3.14   # y is a floating-point number (float)
# name = "Alice"  # name is a string (str)

# ----- Examples of declaring variables -----

# create an integer variable called x and assign it the value 6
x = 6
# print the value stored in variable x - at this point the value 6 is printed on screen
print(x)
# multiply the value stored in variable x by 7 and store the result in variable y
y = x * 7
# print the value stored in variable y - at this point the value 42 is printed on screen
print(y)
