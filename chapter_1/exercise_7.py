# Exercise 7: Working with Variables

# ----- Examples of declaring variables -----
# x = 10      # x is an integer (int)
# y = 3.14   # y is a floating-point number (float)
# name = "Alice"  # name is a string (str)
# In Python, you can use either single quotes or double quotes for strings
# ----- Examples of declaring variables -----

# create an integer variable called x and assign it the value 43
x = 43
# add 1 to the value stored in variable x
x = x + 1
# print the value stored in variable x - at this point value should be 44
print(x)
